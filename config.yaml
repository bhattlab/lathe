# data input
# file_names_txt is a 2 or 3 column tsv with the following columns
# SAMPLE_NAME     FAST5/FASTQ_READS      SHORT_READS_1,SHORT_READS_2
# sample name in the first column will be used to name ouptut
# the second column can be a directory containing fast5 files (the output of a nanopore run)
#   -OR- a single fastq file containing basecalled data 
# Optionally, a short read sequencing dataset can be provided in the third column, 
#   with pairs separated by a comma. If this option is selected, short read
#   polishing will be turned on.

                        #merging. This would be suitable for bacterial isolate data, small datasets or very simple
